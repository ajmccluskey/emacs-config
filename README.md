emacs-config
============

My emacs config, complete with automatic install of packages

Some things to note

* Marmalade is included
* A set of packages is automatically installed if any are not already present
* We're aiming to be modular, so that any config/init that is not general is
  encapsulated in a separate .el file and loaded by init.el
